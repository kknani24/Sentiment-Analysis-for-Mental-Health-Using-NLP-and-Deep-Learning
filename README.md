# Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health Using NLP and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze mental health statements using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Deep Learning models. It focuses on classifying mental health status based on textual data, providing insights into the distribution of mental health conditions, and visualizing the results.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- plotly
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- textblob
- numpy
- wordcloud
- matplotlib
- tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly nltk scikit-learn textblob numpy wordcloud matplotlib tensorflow
```

Additionally, you need to download NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset named 'Combined Data.csv'. This dataset contains statements related to mental health and their corresponding status labels. The main columns used are:
- `statement`: The textual content describing mental health experiences.
- `status`: The mental health status label associated with each statement.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning text data (removing punctuation, links, etc.)
   - Tokenization
   - Removing stop words

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the distribution of mental health status labels
   - Examining text length distribution

3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Using translation techniques to augment the dataset

4. **Model Development**:
   - Tokenization and padding of sequences
   - Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow/Keras
   - Training the model on the preprocessed data

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessing model performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

## Results

The CNN model achieves [insert accuracy here] accuracy on the test set. Detailed performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, are provided in the classification report.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations to aid in understanding the data and results:

1. Distribution of Mental Health Status
2. Text Length Distribution
3. Confusion Matrix
4. Word Cloud of Cleaned Statements
5. Proportion of Each Status Category (Pie Chart)

These visualizations offer insights into the dataset characteristics and model performance.

## Future Work

1. Experiment with different deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM, Transformer-based models)
2. Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques like sentiment analysis scores as features
3. Explore multi-label classification if applicable to the mental health domain
4. Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation
5. Develop an interactive web application for real-time mental health statement analysis
